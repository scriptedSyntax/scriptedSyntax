# ðŸ©º Symptom Checker Gone Rogue â€“ Help Fix It!  

## ðŸš‘ What's the Problem?  
I built a small **Symptom Checker** app, but itâ€™s turned into a bit of a brainless AI! Itâ€™s struggling to do its job, and needs some backend love to get it working properly. Hereâ€™s what needs fixing:  

- **Bad Symptom Matching** â€“ It's spitting out unreliable or outright strange results.  
- **Messy Dataset** â€“ Somethingâ€™s off with the dataset, the weights are probably wrong, and some conditions are missing.  
- **Backend Instability** â€“ Random crashes, errors, and an overall feeling that things could be a lot more stable.  
- **User Input Issues** â€“ Sometimes it misreads inputs or doesnâ€™t respond as expected.  

## ðŸ›  How You Can Help

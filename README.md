# ⚡🐍 Samuel – Python Dev Who Builds Systems That Actually Work 🚀  

I don’t do fluff. I write **Python**, and I build systems that don’t fall apart when people actually use them.  

🔥 Think:  
- 🏗️ Backends that scale without crying  
- 🔌 APIs that play nice together  
- 🤖 Automations so you don’t waste time on boring stuff  
- ⚡ Prototypes that turn into real products (fast)

## 🐍 My main stack  
Python is home base. Clean, efficient, and production-ready.  

But I’m not stuck in one lane:  
- 💻 **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** (for the web stuff)  
- 🗄️ **SQL** (because data always needs love)  
- 🌐 **Node / PHP / Java** (when the stack gets messy)

## 🔨 Things I’ve actually built  
- 🛠️ SaaS platforms that don’t choke under traffic  
- ⚡ AI prototypes on stupid short deadlines  
- 🩺 APIs wired into healthcare, 📚 education, and 🛒 e-com (where you can’t screw up)  
- 🎓 LMS systems with chatbot tutors, auto-grading, and role-based access  
- 🧑‍💻 Avatar-based onboarding + training with **D-ID + Synthesia**

## 🧰 My toolbox  
- 🐍 Python / Django / Streamlit  
- 🔥 Firebase / Google Colab  
- 🤖 OpenAI API / LangChain  
- 🛠️ GitHub / Postman  
- 🎨 Tailwind / Bootstrap / a sprinkle of React

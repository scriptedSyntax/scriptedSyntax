# ðŸ©º Symptom Checker Gone Rogue â€“ Help Fix It!  

## ðŸš‘ What's the Problem?  
Built a small **symptom checker**, but it's a brainless AI... someone help fix its brains (backend fix). Hereâ€™s what needs fixing:  

- **Bad symptom matching** â€“ Keeps giving weird or unreliable results.  
- **Messy dataset** â€“ Feels like the weightings are off or something. I don't know 
- **Backend instability** â€“ Random errors, crashes, and overall bad vibes.  If you could give it a backend it would be nice!

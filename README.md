## ðŸš‘ What's the Problem?  
Built a small symptom checker, but its a brainless AI... someone help its brains(backend fix) Here's what needs fixing:  

- **Bad symptom matching** â€“ Keeps giving weird or unreliable results.  
- **Messy dataset** â€“ Feels like the weightings are off or some conditions are missing.  
- **Backend instability** â€“ Random errors, crashes, and overall bad vibes.  
- **User input issues** â€“ Sometimes it misreads inputs or doesnâ€™t respond correctly.
